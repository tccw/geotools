    "👮🚨This notebook is sort of like my personal notes on this subject. It will be changed and updated whenever I have time to work on it. This is not meant to replace a thorough fluid substitution workflow. The intent here is make the major assumptions underlying the process of evaluating the affect of fluid fill on seismic response a little more clear, as well as provide references and background in literature for further study.🚨\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point I will probably generalize this better so it can be used with real curves. For now it creates some fake blocked logs you can edit just to get a feel for how fluid sub works and how the different fluid fills might look in seismic. Also, currently the rocks are monomineralic. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Note: \n",
    "The proper conditioning of logs, calibration of water saturations, reservoir selection for substituion, and rock and mineral parameter selection and calibration are extremely important to the reliability of a fluid substitution's output. These are good candidates for additional tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is focused on the basic workflow from the geophysical perspective and therefore assumes the labor intensive petrophysical work mentioned above is both completed and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notes for future:\n",
    "* ~~Incorporate a tuning section~~ (Dashed lines show when the bed is thin enough to be affected by tuning.)\n",
    "* ~~Put the whole thing in a function and see if I can get interact working so I can just use sliders to change parameters~~\n",
    "* Generalize so real .las files can be loaded\n",
    "* ~~Complete the implementation of the B&W fluid property equations~~\n",

    "### Gassmann's Equations\n",
    "Gassmann's equations (seen below) describes how the bulk modulus (ratio of pressure change to volume change) of a saturated rock changes as the saturating fluid changes. It provides a useful means for modeling how the seismic response of a formation may change for different filling fluids.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a discussion of the origin and derivation of Gassmann's equations, see Berryman, 2000 (https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1444667) \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Porous material is isotropic, elastic, monomineralic, and homogeneous\n",
    "2. Pore sapce is well connected and in pressure equilibrium\n",
    "3. Medium is a closed system with no pore fluid movement across boundaries\n",
    "4. No checmical interaction between fluids and rock frame (i.e. no diagenetic processes)\n",
    "5. Frequency effects are negligible when considering the measurements. Gassmann's equations are valid only for seismic frequencies (<100 Hz from Mavko, 1998).\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions are often violated in real reservoirs. However, Gassmann's model is still generally the preferred model as it can be easily parameterized. A number of publications exist which suggest ways to modify inputs or assumptions to make these relationships more applicable to more variable rocks. A good general discussion of this can be found in Rob Simm's 2007 article \"Practical Gassmann fluid substitution in sand/shale sequences [DOI: 10.3997//1365-2387.2007030](http://dreamcell-dev.co.uk/rpa/papers_downloads/RPA_simm_2007.pdf).\n",
